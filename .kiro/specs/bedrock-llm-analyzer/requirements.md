# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a local web application that serves as a test harness for experimenting with AWS Bedrock LLM models. The application will allow users to quickly test different LLM models with various prompt structures and input data to compare results and find optimal configurations. It maintains a complete history of experiments for analysis and comparison.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer/researcher, I want to select from available Amazon Bedrock LLM models, so that I can test and compare different models for my specific use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a dropdown or selection interface with available Bedrock LLM models
2. WHEN I select an LLM model THEN the system SHALL store my selection for the current test session
3. IF no model is selected THEN the system SHALL prevent test execution and display an appropriate message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer/researcher, I want to select from available datasets and customize prompts, so that I can test different prompt structures against consistent data sets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the application THEN the system SHALL dynamically load available dataset types from the datasets directory
2. WHEN I select a dataset type THEN the system SHALL display available dataset options for that type
3. WHEN I select a dataset option THEN the system SHALL load the dataset content for testing
4. WHEN I enter a prompt THEN the system SHALL validate that the prompt is not empty

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer/researcher, I want to test LLM models with selected datasets, so that I can evaluate how different models perform with consistent data across different use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I trigger a test THEN the system SHALL send the prompt and selected dataset content to the chosen Bedrock LLM using local AWS credentials
2. WHEN the test is executed THEN the system SHALL display the LLM response in a readable format
3. WHEN the LLM responds THEN the system SHALL display the complete response in a readable format
4. IF AWS credentials are not configured THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer/researcher, I want to view a history of my test sessions, so that I can compare different models and prompt configurations across various datasets to identify the best performing combinations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I complete a test THEN the system SHALL save the prompt, dataset type, dataset option, selected model, and response to local history
2. WHEN I access the history section THEN the system SHALL display all previous test sessions with timestamps, model information, and dataset details
3. WHEN I view a historical entry THEN the system SHALL show the complete prompt, dataset information, model used, and full response
4. WHEN I select a historical entry THEN the system SHALL allow me to rerun the test with the same configuration

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer/researcher, I want to see well-formatted responses with performance metrics, so that I can easily compare results across different models and configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system displays LLM responses THEN the system SHALL format the text with proper typography and spacing
2. WHEN responses contain structured data THEN the system SHALL present it in an organized, readable format
3. WHEN responses are lengthy THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate scrolling and layout management
4. WHEN comparing multiple tests THEN the system SHALL provide side-by-side comparison views

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer/researcher, I want to run the application locally with minimal setup, so that I can quickly start testing LLM models and configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start the application THEN the system SHALL run locally without requiring external deployments
2. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL use my existing local AWS credentials automatically
3. WHEN I access the application THEN the system SHALL provide a clean, intuitive user interface optimized for testing workflows
4. IF the application encounters errors THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages without crashing

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer/researcher, I want to save and load test configurations, so that I can quickly iterate on promising prompt, model, and dataset combinations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a successful test configuration THEN the system SHALL allow me to save it as a template including the prompt, model, and dataset selection
2. WHEN I access saved templates THEN the system SHALL display all saved configurations with descriptive names and dataset information
3. WHEN I load a template THEN the system SHALL populate the prompt, model selection, and dataset selection fields
4. WHEN I modify a loaded template THEN the system SHALL allow me to save it as a new template or update the existing one
