# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical UI and functionality bugs discovered during user testing of the Promptatron 3000 application. The issues include visual display problems with gradients and text wrapping, determinism evaluation triggering incorrectly, missing throttling feedback, lack of response viewing capabilities, model output display failures, and incorrect exact match calculations. These fixes are essential for maintaining a professional user experience and ensuring the application functions as intended.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system prompt display to render correctly without visual artifacts so that I can focus on my work without distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system prompt is long THEN the system SHALL NOT display any white gradient lines across the screen
2. WHEN viewing the system prompt in any component THEN all gradient effects SHALL be properly contained within their intended elements
3. WHEN the system prompt exceeds the container width THEN the text SHALL wrap properly and remain fully visible
4. WHEN the system prompt is displayed in the test results pane THEN it SHALL wrap to multiple lines instead of running off screen
5. WHEN any gradient effects are applied THEN they SHALL be positioned correctly and not interfere with text readability

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the determinism evaluation to automatically start when the toggle is enabled and I run a test so that I can easily evaluate model consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the determinism evaluation toggle is ON and I click "Run test" THEN the determinism evaluation SHALL automatically start after the initial test completes
2. WHEN the determinism evaluation toggle is OFF and I click "Run test" THEN the determinism evaluation SHALL NOT run
3. WHEN the determinism evaluation is running THEN it SHALL display a progress bar showing completion status
4. WHEN the determinism evaluation completes THEN it SHALL show a clickable letter grade (A, B, C, D, F)
5. WHEN I click the letter grade THEN it SHALL open detailed results showing all responses and analysis

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to understand when the determinism evaluation is being throttled so that I know why the process is taking longer than expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the determinism evaluation encounters AWS throttling THEN the system SHALL display a message in the evaluation summary
2. WHEN throttling occurs THEN the message SHALL clearly indicate that "execution was throttled by AWS rate limits"
3. WHEN the evaluation completes after throttling THEN the summary SHALL include the throttling information
4. WHEN multiple throttling events occur THEN the system SHALL track and report the total number of throttling incidents
5. WHEN no throttling occurs THEN no throttling message SHALL be displayed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view all individual responses from the determinism evaluation so that I can analyze the variations myself.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the determinism evaluation completes THEN the system SHALL provide a tab or section to view all responses
2. WHEN I access the responses view THEN I SHALL see all 30 individual responses in a readable format
3. WHEN viewing responses THEN each response SHALL be clearly numbered or identified
4. WHEN responses are long THEN they SHALL be properly formatted with scrolling or pagination
5. WHEN I close the responses view THEN I SHALL return to the main determinism results display

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the model response field to consistently display output with proper streaming support so that I can see responses as they generate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test completes THEN the model response field SHALL always display the output text
2. WHEN streaming is enabled and a model generates text THEN the response SHALL stream live to the output field
3. WHEN streaming is disabled THEN the complete response SHALL appear once generation is finished
4. WHEN I navigate to the history tab and return THEN the model response field SHALL still display the current output
5. WHEN the model response field fails to display THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messaging and retry options

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the exact match metric in determinism evaluation to be calculated correctly so that I can trust the accuracy of the results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating exact matches THEN the system SHALL NOT compare the initial result to itself
2. WHEN the determinism evaluation runs THEN the exact match percentage SHALL be calculated only among the 30 evaluation responses
3. WHEN all responses are identical THEN the exact match SHALL be 100%
4. WHEN no responses are identical THEN the exact match SHALL be 0%
5. WHEN some responses are identical THEN the exact match SHALL reflect the actual percentage of matching responses

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling for UI state management so that display issues don't cascade into application failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UI components encounter display errors THEN they SHALL log the error and attempt graceful recovery
2. WHEN gradient or CSS effects fail to render THEN the component SHALL fall back to basic styling
3. WHEN text wrapping fails THEN the system SHALL apply fallback CSS rules to ensure readability
4. WHEN model output display fails THEN the system SHALL show an error message and retry mechanism
5. WHEN state management issues occur THEN the system SHALL preserve user data and provide recovery options

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see clear progress and status information during determinism evaluation so that I understand what's happening and how long it will take.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN determinism evaluation starts THEN a progress bar SHALL appear showing completion percentage
2. WHEN the evaluation is running THEN the progress bar SHALL update in real-time as each test completes
3. WHEN the evaluation encounters throttling THEN the status SHALL indicate "Throttled by AWS - retrying..."
4. WHEN the evaluation completes THEN the progress bar SHALL show 100% and display the final letter grade
5. WHEN the evaluation fails THEN the status SHALL show a clear error message with retry options

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent and reliable UI behavior across all application states so that I can work efficiently without unexpected interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switching between tabs THEN all UI elements SHALL maintain their proper state and appearance
2. WHEN returning from navigation THEN previously displayed content SHALL remain accessible
3. WHEN the application encounters errors THEN the UI SHALL provide clear feedback and recovery options
4. WHEN long operations are running THEN the UI SHALL remain responsive and provide appropriate feedback
5. WHEN multiple operations are in progress THEN the UI SHALL clearly indicate the status of each operation
