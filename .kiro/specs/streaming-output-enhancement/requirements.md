# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the Bedrock LLM Analyzer with real-time streaming capabilities and improved output management. Users will see LLM responses appear token by token as they are generated, providing immediate feedback and a more engaging experience. The robot graphic will visually indicate when the AI is actively generating responses, and users will have convenient options to copy the generated output.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user running LLM tests, I want to see responses streaming in real-time token by token, so that I can immediately see progress and get faster feedback on the AI's response.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a test THEN the system SHALL begin streaming the LLM response token by token
2. WHEN tokens are being received THEN the system SHALL display each token immediately as it arrives
3. WHEN streaming is active THEN the system SHALL show a visual indicator that content is being generated
4. WHEN streaming completes THEN the system SHALL indicate that the full response has been received
5. IF streaming fails or is interrupted THEN the system SHALL display any partial content received and show an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user watching LLM responses generate, I want the robot graphic to show a "talking" state during streaming, so that I have clear visual feedback that the AI is actively working.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN streaming begins THEN the robot graphic SHALL transition to a "talking" or "generating" visual state
2. WHEN tokens are actively streaming THEN the robot SHALL maintain animated visual indicators of speech/generation
3. WHEN streaming completes successfully THEN the robot SHALL transition to a "completed" or neutral state
4. WHEN streaming encounters an error THEN the robot SHALL transition to an appropriate error state
5. WHEN no streaming is active THEN the robot SHALL display its default idle state

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user who has received LLM output, I want a convenient "Copy Output" button, so that I can easily use the generated content in other applications or documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a response has been generated THEN the system SHALL display a "Copy Output" button near the response text
2. WHEN a user clicks "Copy Output" THEN the system SHALL copy the complete response text to the clipboard
3. WHEN content is successfully copied THEN the system SHALL show a brief confirmation message
4. IF copying fails THEN the system SHALL show an error message and provide alternative copy methods
5. WHEN no response is available THEN the "Copy Output" button SHALL be disabled or hidden

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user running multiple tests, I want streaming to work reliably across different models and test scenarios, so that I have consistent performance regardless of which Bedrock model I'm using.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using any supported Bedrock model THEN streaming SHALL work consistently across all models
2. WHEN switching between models THEN streaming functionality SHALL remain available and functional
3. WHEN running tests with different prompt lengths THEN streaming SHALL handle both short and long responses appropriately
4. WHEN network conditions vary THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle streaming interruptions and reconnections
5. IF a model doesn't support streaming THEN the system SHALL fall back to non-streaming mode with appropriate user notification
