# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application currently uses separate tool services (fraudToolsService, shippingToolsService) for each scenario's tool execution. This creates code duplication and maintenance overhead. This featere will factor the tool execution system to use a handler-based approach similar to AWS Lambda functions, where each tool points to a specific file and entry point (filename.entry) for execution. A single tool execution service will parse the handler configuration and dynamically execute the appropriate code.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tools to be defined with handler configurations so that I can specify exactly where each tool's implementation code is located.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tool is defined in a scenario THEN it SHALL support a `handler` property in the format "filename.entry"
2. WHEN a tool has a handler property THEN the filename SHALL point to a JavaScript file in the scenario directory
3. WHEN a tool has a handler property THEN the entry SHALL specify the function name to execute within that file
4. WHEN a tool does not have a handler property THEN the system SHALL fall back to legacy tool service execution
5. WHEN a handler format is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages about the expected format

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single tool execution service that can dynamically load and execute handler-based tools so that I don't need separate service classes for each scenario.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool execution service encounters a tool with a handler THEN it SHALL parse the handler string to extract filename and entry point
2. WHEN the tool execution service loads a handler file THEN it SHALL dynamically import the JavaScript module from the scenario directory
3. WHEN the tool execution service executes a handler THEN it SHALL call the specified entry point function with the tool parameters
4. WHEN a handler file cannot be found THEN the service SHALL provide a clear error message with the expected file path
5. WHEN a handler entry point does not exist THEN the service SHALL provide a clear error message about the missing function

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate existing fraud detection tools to the handler-based system so that they use the new architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fraud detection tools are migrated THEN each tool SHALL have a handler property pointing to its implementation
2. WHEN fraud detection handlers are created THEN they SHALL maintain the same functionality as the current fraudToolsService methods
3. WHEN fraud detection handlers are executed THEN they SHALL receive the same parameters and context as before
4. WHEN fraud detection handlers complete THEN they SHALL return the same response format as before
5. WHEN fraud detection handlers encounter errors THEN they SHALL provide the same error handling as before

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate existing shipping logistics tools to the handler-based system so that they use the new architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN shipping logistics tools are migrated THEN each tool SHALL have a handler property pointing to its implementation
2. WHEN shipping logistics handlers are created THEN they SHALL maintain the same functionality as the current shippingToolsService methods
3. WHEN shipping logistics handlers are executed THEN they SHALL receive the same parameters and context as before
4. WHEN shipping logistics handlers complete THEN they SHALL return the same response format as before
5. WHEN shipping logistics handlers encounter errors THEN they SHALL provide the same error handling as before

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove the old tool service classes so that the codebase is cleaner and there's no confusion about which execution path is used.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the fraudToolsService class SHALL be removed from the codebase
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the shippingToolsService class SHALL be removed from the codebase
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all imports of the old tool services SHALL be removed
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the toolExecutionService SHALL no longer reference the old service classes
5. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all tool execution SHALL go through the handler-based system

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the handler-based system to support the same execution context and storage patterns as the current tool services so that existing functionality is preserved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a handler is executed THEN it SHALL receive the same context object as current tool implementations
2. WHEN a handler needs storage THEN it SHALL have access to the same IndexedDB patterns as current implementations
3. WHEN a handler needs to validate parameters THEN it SHALL have access to the same validation utilities
4. WHEN a handler needs to generate realistic responses THEN it SHALL have access to the same helper functions
5. WHEN a handler encounters errors THEN it SHALL use the same error handling patterns as current implementations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want tool execution to work exactly the same way after the refactoring so that my workflow is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run tests with tools THEN the execution behavior SHALL be identical to before the refactoring
2. WHEN tools execute successfully THEN the response format SHALL be identical to before the refactoring
3. WHEN tools encounter errors THEN the error messages SHALL be identical to before the refactoring
4. WHEN I view tool execution results THEN the display format SHALL be identical to before the refactoring
5. WHEN I use tool execution features THEN the performance SHALL be comparable to before the refactoring

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation and examples of how to create handler-based tools so that I can easily add new tools in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new handler-based tool THEN there SHALL be clear documentation on the handler format
2. WHEN creating a new handler file THEN there SHALL be examples showing the expected function signature
3. WHEN creating a new handler THEN there SHALL be examples showing how to access context and storage
4. WHEN creating a new handler THEN there SHALL be examples showing proper error handling
5. WHEN creating a new handler THEN there SHALL be examples showing how to return properly formatted responses
