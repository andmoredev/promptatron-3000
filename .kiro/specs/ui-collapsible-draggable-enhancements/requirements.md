# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines user interface enhancements to improve the usability and screen experience of the Bedrock LLM Analyzer. The improvements focus on making the interface more compact and customizable by adding collapsible sections, draggable robot functionality with persistent positioning, and enhanced textarea controls. These changes will make the application more suitable for presentations and screen sharing while maintaining full functionality.

6. WHEN a section is collapsed THEN the system SHALL hide the section content while keeping the header visible
7. WHEN a section is expanded THEN the system SHALL show the full section content
8. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL remember the previous collapse/expand state of each section
9. WHEN a section is collapsed THEN the system SHALL show a visual indicator (chevron or similar) pointing right
10. WHEN a section is expanded THEN the system SHALL show a visual indicator (chevron or similar) pointing down
11. WHEN sections are collapsed/expanded THEN the system SHALL animate the transition smoothly

### Requirement 2: Draggable Robot with Persistent Positioning

**User Story:** As a user, I want to click and drag the Chad robot around the screen so that I can position him where he won't interfere with my work or screen sharing, and have his position remembered between sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Chad robot is visible THEN the system SHALL allow the user to click and drag him to any position on the screen
2. WHEN dragging the robot THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback showing the robot is being moved
3. WHEN dragging the robot THEN the system SHALL ensure he follows the mouse cursor smoothly
4. WHEN the robot is dropped THEN the system SHALL save his new position to localStorage
5. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL restore the robot to his last saved position
6. WHEN the robot is dragged THEN the system SHALL ensure he always appears on top of other UI elements (highest z-index)
7. WHEN the robot is dragged near screen edges THEN the system SHALL prevent him from being dragged completely off-screen
8. WHEN the robot is being dragged THEN the system SHALL show a visual indicator (like a subtle glow or cursor change)
9. WHEN the robot is not being dragged THEN the system SHALL maintain his normal appearance and animations
10. WHEN the robot position is saved THEN the system SHALL handle different screen sizes gracefully on reload
11. WHEN no saved position exists THEN the system SHALL use the default bottom-left position

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Textarea Controls

**User Story:** As a user, I want the prompt textareas to be manually resizable and properly editable so that I can adjust them to fit my content and easily paste or edit text without scrolling issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN viewing user prompt textarea THEN the system SHALL allow manual resizing by dragging the bottom-right corner
3. WHEN text is pasted into any textarea THEN the system SHALL ensure the textarea remains editable and scrollable
4. WHEN text content exceeds the textarea height THEN the system SHALL provide proper scrolling functionality
5. WHEN typing in any textarea THEN the system SHALL ensure the cursor and text remain visible
6. WHEN resizing a textarea THEN the system SHALL maintain the new size until the user changes it again
7. WHEN long content is pasted THEN the system SHALL auto-expand the textarea to show more content (up to a reasonable maximum)
8. WHEN a textarea is manually resized THEN the system SHALL save the preferred size to localStorage
9. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL restore the saved textarea sizes
10. WHEN textareas are resized THEN the system SHALL ensure they don't break the overall layout
11. WHEN textareas have focus THEN the system SHALL ensure proper keyboard navigation and text selection

### Requirement 4: Persistent UI State Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to remember my UI preferences (collapsed sections, robot position, textarea sizes) between sessions so that I don't have to reconfigure the interface every time I use the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any section is collapsed or expanded THEN the system SHALL save the state to localStorage
2. WHEN the robot is moved THEN the system SHALL save the position coordinates to localStorage
3. WHEN textareas are resized THEN the system SHALL save the dimensions to localStorage
4. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL restore all saved UI preferences
5. WHEN localStorage is not available THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to default settings
6. WHEN saved preferences are corrupted THEN the system SHALL reset to defaults and continue functioning
7. WHEN the screen size changes significantly THEN the system SHALL adjust saved positions to remain visible
8. WHEN preferences are saved THEN the system SHALL use a consistent naming scheme for localStorage keys
9. WHEN multiple browser tabs are open THEN the system SHALL sync UI state changes across tabs when possible
10. WHEN clearing browser data THEN the system SHALL handle missing preferences gracefully

### Requirement 5: Improved Screen Sharing Experience

**User Story:** As a presenter, I want to optimize the interface for screen sharing by having compact, collapsible sections and a moveable robot so that I can focus viewer attention on the most relevant parts of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sections are collapsed THEN the system SHALL maximize available space for test results and output
2. WHEN the robot is repositioned THEN the system SHALL ensure he doesn't obstruct important UI elements during demos
