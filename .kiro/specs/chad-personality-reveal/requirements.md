# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces "Chad" as the robot's personality, creating a more engaging and prominent character throughout the Bedrock LLM Analyzer application. Chad will be revealed during a live stream event, starting with the original robot design and then transforming into Chad with distinctive styling (hat and polo shirt). The feature includes a floating Chad companion and a reveal mechanism for the live demonstration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a distinctive "Chad" version of the robot so that the application has more personality and character.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Chad personality is active THEN the robot SHALL display with a hat and polo shirt styling
2. WHEN the Chad personality is active THEN the robot SHALL maintain all existing facial expressions and animations
3. WHEN the Chad personality is active THEN the robot SHALL use the same state mapping and behavior as the original robot
4. IF the Chad personality is not revealed THEN the system SHALL show the original robot design

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see Chad prominently displayed throughout the application so that the character feels like a consistent companion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the application THEN Chad SHALL appear as a floating element in the bottom left corner
2. WHEN Chad is floating THEN it SHALL NOT interfere with existing UI components or layouts
3. WHEN Chad is floating THEN it SHALL be responsive and scale appropriately on different screen sizes
4. WHEN Chad is floating THEN it SHALL maintain subtle animations to feel alive
5. WHEN Chad is floating THEN it SHALL reflect the current application state (idle, thinking, processing, etc.)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a presenter, I want to reveal Chad during a live stream so that I can create an engaging moment for the audience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL show the original robot design by default
2. WHEN I click the "Reveal Agent" button THEN the system SHALL transform the robot into Chad
3. WHEN the reveal happens THEN there SHALL be a smooth transition animation from original to Chad
4. WHEN Chad is revealed THEN the floating Chad SHALL also appear
5. WHEN the "Reveal Agent" button is clicked THEN it SHALL be replaced with Chad's name or removed
6. IF Chad is already revealed THEN the "Reveal Agent" button SHALL NOT be visible

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Chad feature to integrate seamlessly with existing functionality so that it doesn't disrupt my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Chad is active THEN all existing robot state functionality SHALL continue to work
2. WHEN Chad is active THEN the robot SHALL still respond to application states (loading, error, success, etc.)
3. WHEN Chad is floating THEN it SHALL NOT block clickable elements or important UI
4. WHEN Chad is floating THEN it SHALL have appropriate z-index to stay above content but below modals
5. WHEN on mobile devices THEN Chad SHALL scale appropriately and not obstruct touch targets

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want Chad to remain revealed after I've activated him so that I don't have to reveal him again on subsequent visits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Chad is revealed THEN the system SHALL save the reveal state to local storage
2. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL check local storage for the reveal state
3. WHEN Chad was previously revealed THEN the application SHALL load with Chad active and the floating Chad visible
4. WHEN Chad was previously revealed THEN the "Reveal Agent" button SHALL NOT be visible on load
5. WHEN local storage is cleared THEN the application SHALL revert to showing the original robot

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Chad feature to be maintainable and follow existing patterns so that it's easy to extend and modify.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing Chad THEN it SHALL reuse existing RobotGraphic components and patterns
2. WHEN implementing Chad THEN it SHALL follow the established styling and animation patterns
3. WHEN implementing Chad THEN it SHALL use the existing state management and prop patterns
4. WHEN implementing Chad THEN it SHALL maintain accessibility features from the original robot
5. WHEN implementing Chad THEN it SHALL be configurable through props or state management
6. WHEN implementing persistence THEN it SHALL use existing storage utilities or patterns from the codebase
