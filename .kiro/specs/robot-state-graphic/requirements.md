# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces a state-driven robot graphic component that provides visual feedback to users through different facial expressions based on the application's current state. The robot will display appropriate emotions (happy, thinking, talking, error) to enhance user experience and provide clear visual indicators of system status during prompt processing and response generation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a robot graphic that shows different facial expressions based on the application state, so that I can easily understand what the system is currently doing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is idle THEN the robot SHALL display a happy face expression
2. WHEN a prompt is submitted THEN the robot SHALL immediately display a thinking face expression
3. WHEN the system is streaming a response THEN the robot SHALL display a talking face expression
4. WHEN an error or failure occurs THEN the robot SHALL display an error/concerned face expression
5. WHEN the state changes THEN the robot SHALL smoothly transition between facial expressions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the robot graphic to be visually appealing and consistent with the application's design, so that it feels integrated and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the robot is displayed THEN it SHALL use consistent styling with the application's theme
2. WHEN the robot changes expressions THEN the transitions SHALL be smooth and not jarring
3. WHEN the robot is rendered THEN it SHALL be appropriately sized for the interface
4. WHEN the application theme changes THEN the robot SHALL adapt to maintain visual consistency

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the robot component to be reusable and maintainable, so that it can be easily integrated and updated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the robot component THEN it SHALL accept state as a prop
2. WHEN the component receives a state change THEN it SHALL update the facial expression accordingly
3. WHEN the component is used THEN it SHALL be self-contained with no external dependencies for basic functionality
4. WHEN the component is tested THEN it SHALL have comprehensive unit tests for all state transitions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the robot graphic to provide immediate feedback, so that I know the system has received my input and is processing it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a prompt THEN the robot SHALL change to thinking state within 100ms
2. WHEN the system begins streaming a response THEN the robot SHALL change to talking state immediately
3. WHEN an operation completes successfully THEN the robot SHALL return to happy state
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN the robot SHALL display error state and remain until the error is resolved or dismissed
