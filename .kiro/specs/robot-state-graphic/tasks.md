  - Ensure robot maintains aspect ratio across screen sizes
  - Implement mobile-specific optimizations
  - Test responsive behavior across different viewport sizes
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 11. Performance optimization and testing

  - Optimize animation performance using CSS transforms
  - Implement lazy loading for animation assets if needed
  - Add performance monitoring for animation frame rates
  - Write performance tests to ensure smooth operation
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 2.2_

- [ ] 12. Cross-browser compatibility and final testing
