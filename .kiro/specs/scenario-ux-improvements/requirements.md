# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines user experience improvements for the scenario-driven interface in the Bedrock LLM Analyzer. The current scenario interface has several UX issues that make it cluttered and confusing for users. This specification addresses specific UI/UX problems to create a cleaner, more intuitive experience when working with scenarios.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Simplified Scenario Information Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see only essential information when I select a scenario, so that I can focus on the tools and functionality available without visual clutter.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a scenario is selected THEN the system SHALL hide the comprehensive analysis box (scenario metadata section)
2. WHEN a scenario is selected THEN the system SHALL display only a simple list of tools that were loaded from the scenario
3. WHEN a scenario has tools THEN the system SHALL show the tool names in a clean, minimal list format
4. WHEN a scenario has no tools THEN the system SHALL not display any tool information section
5. WHEN a scenario is deselected THEN the system SHALL hide all scenario-specific information displays

### Requirement 2: Streamlined Template Labels

**User Story:** As a user, I want simplified template labels in the prompt configuration, so that the interface is less verbose and easier to understand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the prompt editor THEN the system SHALL display "Templates" instead of "System Prompt Templates"
2. WHEN viewing the prompt editor THEN the system SHALL display "Templates" instead of "User Prompt Templates"
3. WHEN templates are available THEN the system SHALL maintain the same functionality with the simplified labels
4. WHEN no templates are available THEN the system SHALL not show the template sections

### Requirement 3: Proper Newline Rendering in Prompts

**User Story:** As a user, I want newlines in prompt templates to render correctly, so that multi-line prompts display properly instead of showing escaped characters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a prompt template contains newline characters THEN the system SHALL render them as actual line breaks
2. WHEN displaying prompt content THEN the system SHALL preserve the original formatting and line structure
3. WHEN a user selects a template THEN the system SHALL populate the prompt field with properly formatted text
4. WHEN prompt text is displayed THEN the system SHALL not show escaped newline characters like \n

### Requirement 4: Compact Execution Settings Layout

**User Story:** As a user, I want the maximum iterations field to take up less space, so that the execution settings section is more compact and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing execution settings THEN the system SHALL display the maximum iterations field in a more compact layout
2. WHEN the maximum iterations field is shown THEN the system SHALL reduce unnecessary spacing and padding
3. WHEN execution settings are displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain functionality while using less vertical space
4. WHEN tool settings are available THEN the system SHALL organize them in a space-efficient manner

### Requirement 5: Remove Unnecessary Tool Execution Dialog

**User Story:** As a user, I want to remove the blue "Tool Execution Mode Active" dialog, so that the interface is cleaner and less cluttered.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tool execution is enabled THEN the system SHALL not display the blue "Tool Execution Mode Active" information dialog
2. WHEN tools are available THEN the system SHALL indicate tool availability through other UI elements
3. WHEN tool execution mode is active THEN the system SHALL provide status information through more subtle indicators
4. WHEN the tool execution dialog is removed THEN the system SHALL maintain all tool execution functionality

### Requirement 6: Dynamic Dataset Selection Visibility

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dataset selection to appear only when the scenario requires it, so that I don't see irrelevant controls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a scenario has datasets configured THEN the system SHALL show the dataset selection picker under the scenario picker
2. WHEN a scenario has no datasets THEN the system SHALL hide the dataset selection picker entirely
3. WHEN switching between scenarios THEN the system SHALL dynamically show/hide the dataset picker based on scenario configuration
4. WHEN a scenario is deselected THEN the system SHALL hide the dataset selection picker
5. WHEN dataset selection is shown THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing dataset selection functionality

### Requirement 7: Seed Data Refresh Indicator

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a refresh icon when a scenario has seed data, so that I can easily refresh the data when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a scenario has seed data configured THEN the system SHALL display a refresh seed data icon next to the scenario name
2. WHEN a scenario has no seed data THEN the system SHALL not display the refresh icon
3. WHEN the refresh icon is clicked THEN the system SHALL refresh the seed data for the current scenario
4. WHEN seed data is being refreshed THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate loading feedback
5. WHEN seed data refresh completes THEN the system SHALL update the UI with the new data
6. WHEN seed data refresh fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 8: Improved Visual Hierarchy

**User Story:** As a user, I want a cleaner visual hierarchy in the scenario interface, so that I can quickly understand what's available and what actions I can take.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the scenario interface THEN the system SHALL use consistent spacing and visual grouping
2. WHEN multiple UI elements are present THEN the system SHALL organize them with clear visual separation
3. WHEN scenario information is displayed THEN the system SHALL use appropriate typography hierarchy
4. WHEN interactive elements are present THEN the system SHALL make them clearly distinguishable from informational content
5. WHEN the interface adapts to different scenarios THEN the system SHALL maintain visual consistency

### Requirement 9: Responsive Layout Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the scenario interface to work well on different screen sizes, so that the improved UX is consistent across devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL adapt the compact layouts appropriately
2. WHEN viewing on desktop THEN the system SHALL take advantage of available space efficiently
3. WHEN screen size changes THEN the system SHALL maintain the improved UX patterns
4. WHEN elements are hidden/shown dynamically THEN the system SHALL handle responsive behavior correctly
5. WHEN compact layouts are used THEN the system SHALL ensure touch targets remain accessible on mobile

### Requirement 10: Accessibility and Usability

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the improved scenario interface to maintain proper accessibility standards, so that I can use all functionality effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UI elements are hidden/shown dynamically THEN the system SHALL update screen reader announcements appropriately
2. WHEN compact layouts are used THEN the system SHALL maintain proper focus management
3. WHEN template labels are simplified THEN the system SHALL preserve semantic meaning for assistive technologies
4. WHEN visual hierarchy changes THEN the system SHALL maintain logical tab order
5. WHEN interactive elements are modified THEN the system SHALL preserve keyboard accessibility
6. WHEN error states occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear, accessible error messages
