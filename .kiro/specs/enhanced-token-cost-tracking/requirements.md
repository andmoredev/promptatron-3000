# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the Bedrock LLM Analyzer with comprehensive token tracking and cost estimation capabilities. Users will have detailed visibility into token usage patterns, including separate tracking of input tokens, output tokens, and tool-specific tokens. The system will provide accurate cost estimates based on the specific model being used, with a toggleable setting to show or hide cost information. This enhancement will help users understand the financial implications of their AI model usage and make informed decisions about model selection and prompt optimization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Token Tracking

**User Story:** As a developer testing AI models, I want to see detailed token usage breakdown including input, output, and tool tokens, so that I can understand exactly how tokens are being consumed in my requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a model request is made THEN the system SHALL track input tokens separately from output tokens
2. WHEN tool use is involved in a request THEN the system SHALL track tool-specific tokens separately from regular input/output tokens
3. WHEN displaying token information THEN the system SHALL show input tokens, output tokens, tool tokens (if applicable), and total tokens as distinct values
4. WHEN token information is unavailable from the API response THEN the system SHALL estimate tokens using a trusted token estimation library
5. IF token estimation is used THEN the system SHALL indicate that the values are estimated rather than exact

### Requirement 2: Token Estimation Integration

**User Story:** As a user analyzing prompts and responses, I want accurate token counts even when the API doesn't provide them, so that I can consistently track token usage across all my tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API response lacks token usage information THEN the system SHALL use a token estimation library to calculate approximate token counts
2. WHEN estimating tokens THEN the system SHALL use the tiktoken library for OpenAI-compatible models and appropriate estimation methods for other model families
3. WHEN displaying estimated tokens THEN the system SHALL clearly mark them as "estimated" with a visual indicator
4. WHEN both API-provided and estimated tokens are available THEN the system SHALL prefer API-provided tokens and show them as "exact"
5. IF token estimation fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the error and show "N/A" for token counts

### Requirement 3: Cost Calculation and Display

**User Story:** As a cost-conscious developer, I want to see the estimated cost of my AI model requests, so that I can optimize my usage and stay within budget.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cost display is enabled in settings THEN the system SHALL calculate and display estimated costs for each test result
2. WHEN calculating costs THEN the system SHALL use current AWS Bedrock pricing for the specific model being used
3. WHEN displaying costs THEN the system SHALL show input cost, output cost, tool cost (if applicable), and total cost as separate line items
4. WHEN cost information is displayed THEN the system SHALL include a disclaimer that costs are estimates and may vary
5. IF pricing information is unavailable for a model THEN the system SHALL show "Cost unavailable" instead of an estimate

### Requirement 4: Cost Settings Management

**User Story:** As a user who may or may not want to see cost information, I want to toggle cost display on or off, so that I can focus on the metrics that matter most to me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing application settings THEN the system SHALL provide a toggle option for "Show Cost Estimates"
2. WHEN cost display is disabled THEN the system SHALL NOT show any cost-related information in test results, history, or comparisons
3. WHEN cost display is enabled THEN the system SHALL show cost information in all relevant UI components
4. WHEN the cost setting is changed THEN the system SHALL immediately apply the change to all visible results without requiring a page refresh
5. WHEN cost display is disabled THEN the system SHALL NOT perform cost calculations to improve performance

### Requirement 5: Historical Cost Tracking

**User Story:** As a user reviewing my test history, I want to see cost information for past tests when cost display is enabled, so that I can analyze spending patterns over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing test history with cost display enabled THEN the system SHALL show cost estimates for each historical test result
2. WHEN comparing test results with cost display enabled THEN the system SHALL include cost comparison information
3. WHEN cost display setting changes THEN existing historical data SHALL reflect the new setting immediately
4. WHEN exporting or sharing test results THEN cost information SHALL be included only if cost display is enabled
5. IF historical test data lacks sufficient information for cost calculation THEN the system SHALL show "Cost unavailable" for those entries

### Requirement 6: Model-Specific Pricing Integration

**User Story:** As a user testing different AI models, I want accurate cost estimates that reflect the specific pricing structure of each model, so that I can make informed decisions about model selection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating costs THEN the system SHALL use model-specific pricing rates from AWS Bedrock pricing data
2. WHEN a model has different pricing for input vs output tokens THEN the system SHALL apply the correct rates to each token type
3. WHEN tool use incurs additional costs THEN the system SHALL include tool-specific pricing in the total cost calculation
4. WHEN pricing data is updated THEN the system SHALL use the most current pricing information available
5. IF a model's pricing structure changes THEN the system SHALL handle both old and new pricing formats gracefully

### Requirement 7: Performance and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user running multiple tests, I want token and cost calculations to be fast and not slow down my testing workflow, so that I can maintain productivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN token estimation is performed THEN the calculation SHALL complete within 100ms for typical prompt sizes
2. WHEN cost calculations are disabled THEN the system SHALL skip all cost-related processing to maintain optimal performance
3. WHEN displaying results THEN token and cost information SHALL load simultaneously with other result data
4. WHEN switching between cost display modes THEN the UI SHALL update smoothly without noticeable delays
5. IF token estimation or cost calculation fails THEN the system SHALL not block the display of other result information
