# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical issues with the enhanced token display system in the Bedrock LLM Analyzer. The focus is on fixing visual inconsistencies, resolving token usage population defects, and simplifying the cost settings interface. These improvements will ensure that token and cost metrics are displayed consistently and reliably, while streamlining the user interface for better usability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Visual Consistency for Token Metrics

**User Story:** As a user viewing test results, I want all token and cost metrics to have the same visual style as the existing metrics (Characters, Words, Lines, Est. Tokens), so that the interface looks cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing test results THEN all enhanced token metrics SHALL use the same visual styling as Characters, Words, Lines, and Est. Tokens
2. WHEN displaying token metrics THEN Input Tokens, Output Tokens, Tool Tokens (if applicable), and Total Tokens SHALL appear in the same format and layout as existing metrics
3. WHEN cost metrics are enabled THEN Input Cost, Output Cost, Tool Cost (if applicable), and Total Cost SHALL be displayed underneath the token metrics using consistent styling
4. WHEN metrics are displayed THEN the visual hierarchy SHALL clearly separate token metrics from cost metrics while maintaining design consistency
5. WHEN replacing Est. Tokens THEN the system SHALL use Total Tokens from the API response when available

### Requirement 2: Token Usage Population Defect Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer testing AI models, I want token usage data to be reliably populated in the displayResults.usage property, so that I can consistently see accurate token metrics for all my tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a model request is completed THEN the displayResults.usage property SHALL be populated with token usage data
2. WHEN API provides token usage data THEN the system SHALL correctly extract and populate input_tokens, output_tokens, and total_tokens
3. WHEN API does not provide token usage data THEN the system SHALL use token estimation to populate the usage property
4. WHEN token usage is populated THEN the data SHALL be immediately available for display in the TestResults component
5. WHEN debugging token population issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear logging to identify where the population process fails

### Requirement 3: Cost Settings Simplification

**User Story:** As a user managing application settings, I want a simplified cost settings interface without unnecessary options, so that I can easily control cost display without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing settings THEN the system SHALL NOT display "show pricing disclaimer" property or related code
2. WHEN accessing settings THEN the system SHALL NOT display "auto-update pricing" property or related code
3. WHEN the application starts THEN pricing data SHALL be updated only during startup/initialization
4. WHEN viewing settings THEN cost-related settings SHALL be integrated into the Interface tab rather than a separate tab
5. WHEN cost display is toggled THEN a simple toggle button SHALL control the feature with a warning about cost accuracy displayed nearby

### Requirement 4: Settings Interface Reorganization

**User Story:** As a user configuring the application, I want the Interface tab to be the first tab in settings and contain all relevant interface options including cost display, so that I can find all UI-related settings in one logical location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN opening the settings dialog THEN the Interface tab SHALL be the first tab displayed
2. WHEN viewing the Interface tab THEN it SHALL contain the cost display toggle along with other interface settings
3. WHEN cost display is enabled THEN a warning about cost accuracy SHALL be displayed near the toggle
4. WHEN viewing settings THEN performance impact and pricing data information divs SHALL be removed
5. WHEN settings are reorganized THEN all existing interface settings SHALL remain functional and accessible

### Requirement 5: Seamless Token Data Flow

**User Story:** As a user running tests, I want token and cost data to flow seamlessly from the API response through to the display components, so that I always see accurate and up-to-date metrics without any missing data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN BedrockService processes a response THEN token usage data SHALL be correctly extracted and formatted
2. WHEN token data flows to display components THEN the data structure SHALL be consistent and complete
3. WHEN token estimation is used THEN the estimated values SHALL be properly integrated into the display data flow
4. WHEN cost calculations are performed THEN the cost data SHALL be seamlessly integrated with token data
5. WHEN any step in the data flow fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error handling and fallback behavior

### Requirement 6: Debugging and Troubleshooting Support

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the application, I want clear logging and debugging capabilities for token usage population, so that I can quickly identify and resolve any issues with token data flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN token usage data is processed THEN the system SHALL log key steps in the data extraction and population process
2. WHEN token usage population fails THEN the system SHALL log specific error information including the failure point
3. WHEN debugging token issues THEN logs SHALL include the raw API response structure and extracted usage data
4. WHEN token estimation is used THEN the system SHALL log the estimation method and results
5. WHEN troubleshooting THEN logs SHALL be easily accessible and provide actionable information for problem resolution

### Requirement 7: Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a user running multiple tests, I want token and cost display to be fast and reliable, so that my testing workflow is not interrupted by display issues or performance problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying token metrics THEN the rendering SHALL be fast and not cause UI lag
2. WHEN switching cost display on/off THEN the change SHALL be applied immediately without requiring page refresh
3. WHEN token data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the situation without breaking the display
4. WHEN multiple tests are run THEN token and cost display SHALL remain consistent and performant
5. WHEN errors occur in token processing THEN the system SHALL recover gracefully and continue to function normally
