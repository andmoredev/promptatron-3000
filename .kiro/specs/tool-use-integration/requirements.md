# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds the capability for users to enable actual tool execution in the Bedrock LLM Analyzer, transforming it from a tool-tracking system to an interactive tool-using system. Users will be able to toggle between viewing tool calls (current behavior) and actually executing tools, with special handling for fraud detection tools and comprehensive workflow visualization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to enable tool execution mode so that the LLM can actually use tools instead of just showing me what tools it would call.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the application THEN I SHALL see a toggle option to enable "Use Tools" mode
2. WHEN "Use Tools" mode is disabled THEN the system SHALL behave as it currently does (showing tool calls without execution)
3. WHEN "Use Tools" mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL actually execute the tools that the LLM requests
4. WHEN I toggle between modes THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which mode is active
5. WHEN "Use Tools" mode is enabled THEN the interface SHALL show additional controls for tool execution settings

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want determinism evaluation to be disabled when tool execution is enabled so that I don't get inconsistent results due to tool state changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN "Use Tools" mode is enabled THEN the determinism evaluation option SHALL be disabled and hidden
2. WHEN "Use Tools" mode is enabled AND I try to run determinism evaluation THEN the system SHALL prevent the operation and show an appropriate message
3. WHEN I disable "Use Tools" mode THEN the determinism evaluation option SHALL become available again
4. WHEN determinism evaluation is running THEN I SHALL NOT be able to enable "Use Tools" mode

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to set a maximum iteration count for tool execution so that the system doesn't run indefinitely if the LLM gets stuck in a loop.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN "Use Tools" mode is enabled THEN I SHALL see a setting for maximum iteration count
2. WHEN I set the maximum iteration count THEN the system SHALL enforce this limit during tool execution
3. WHEN the iteration count is exceeded THEN the system SHALL stop execution and display a clear message about reaching the limit
4. WHEN execution stops due to iteration limit THEN I SHALL see the partial results and workflow up to that point
5. WHEN I configure the iteration count THEN the system SHALL validate that it's a positive integer between 1 and 50

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the fraud detection tools to actually function when tool execution is enabled so that I can see real analysis results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the LLM requests to use a fraud detection tool THEN the system SHALL execute the tool against the appropriate dataset
2. WHEN fraud tools are executed THEN the system SHALL update local storage or IndexedDB with any state changes
3. WHEN fraud tools process data THEN the system SHALL return actual analysis results to the LLM
4. WHEN fraud tools encounter errors THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully and report meaningful error messages
5. WHEN fraud tools complete successfully THEN the results SHALL be available for the LLM to use in subsequent reasoning

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the entire workflow of LLM tool usage in a timeline view so that I can understand the sequence of operations and decision-making process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tool execution is running THEN I SHALL see a timeline view showing each step of the workflow
2. WHEN the LLM makes a tool call THEN the timeline SHALL show the tool name, parameters, and timestamp
3. WHEN a tool returns results THEN the timeline SHALL show the results and execution time
4. WHEN the LLM processes tool results THEN the timeline SHALL show the reasoning or next steps
5. WHEN execution completes THEN I SHALL be able to review the complete timeline of all operations
6. WHEN I view the timeline THEN I SHALL be able to expand/collapse individual steps for detailed information
7. WHEN errors occur during execution THEN the timeline SHALL clearly mark the error point and show error details

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual feedback during tool execution so that I understand what's happening and can monitor progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tool execution starts THEN I SHALL see a clear indication that tools are being executed
2. WHEN each tool is called THEN I SHALL see real-time updates showing which tool is running
3. WHEN tools are processing THEN I SHALL see appropriate loading indicators
4. WHEN execution completes THEN I SHALL see a clear completion status
5. WHEN I need to stop execution THEN I SHALL have a cancel/stop button available

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want tool execution results to be saved in history so that I can review and compare tool-enabled tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tool-enabled test completes THEN it SHALL be saved to the test history
2. WHEN I view history THEN I SHALL be able to distinguish between tool-enabled and tool-disabled tests
3. WHEN I compare results THEN I SHALL be able to compare tool-enabled tests with regular tests
4. WHEN I view a historical tool-enabled test THEN I SHALL be able to see the complete workflow timeline
5. WHEN tool execution data is saved THEN it SHALL include all tool calls, results, and timeline information

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper error handling during tool execution so that failures don't crash the application and I can understand what went wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tool execution fails THEN the system SHALL continue running and show a clear error message
2. WHEN network errors occur during tool execution THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully with retry logic
3. WHEN tool parameters are invalid THEN the system SHALL validate them and provide helpful error messages
4. WHEN the maximum iteration limit is reached THEN the system SHALL stop gracefully and preserve partial results
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the timeline SHALL show where the error happened and what caused it
